# DFCapstone
Capstone Project at Digital Futures
This project uses fastai.text to create a language model based on the Game of Thrones Script. This language model is then able to generate lines of dialogue for a specified character.

Metrics and stats are available in the ipynb notebook, checking the model accuracy and perplexity.
